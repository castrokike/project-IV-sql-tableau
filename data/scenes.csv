The guy looks dejected.]  COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...  [A monkey jumps on the desk and hands the guy a beer.

JOEY: Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.  ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.  PHOEBE: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin. MONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.  ROSS: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.  RACHEL: Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.  ROSS: Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.  CHANDLER: Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny.

[Ross enters with a suitcase]  ROSS: Hey guys.  ALL: Hey.  PHOEBE: Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?  ROSS: Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

CHANDLER: [Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.  JOEY: Let's get out of here.  [They run out and knock on Monica and Rachel's door]  CHANDLER: The one time they're not home.  JOEY: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met. CHANDLER: That's how radio stars escape stalkers.  JOEY: She's comin'.  [Both run back in their apartment. There's a knock at the door.]  ERICA: It's me.  JOEY: Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?  CHANDLER: Wait, wait, wait.

ROSS: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.  LIPSON: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.  ROSS: Oh my God, what happened?  LIPSON: Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.  ROSS: I can't believe this.  LIPSON: I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.  ROSS: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.  LIPSON: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.  ROSS: Zoo dollars?  LIPSON: Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.  [Scene: Library. Phoebe is getting ready to sing for the kids.

CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.  ROB: You OK?  PHOEBE: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.  ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.  PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?  ROSS: I was thinkin' about it.  PHOEBE: OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe  ALL: Hi Phoebe.  PHOEBE: OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. [singing] Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner.

In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.  ERICA: Who's they?  JOEY: No one.  ERICA: Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.  JOEY: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]  ERICA: No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?  JOEY: Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at that.

Joey and Erica are still there.]  ERICA: I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?  JOEY: Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.  ERICA: No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?

Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.  MONICA: Excellent!  CHANDLER: Very informative!  RACHEL: Not at all inappropriate!  PHOEBE: Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.  ROB: That was great, the kids loved you.  PHOEBE: Yay, I rock.  ROB: And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.  PHOEBE: But.  ROB: How did you know there was a but?  PHOEBE: I sense these things. It was either but or butter.  ROB: The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.  PHOEBE: I can do that.  ROB: Really?  PHOEBE: Yeah.  ROB: Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?  PHOEBE: Thinkin' about it.  [Scene: San Diego Zoo.

ROSS: Buddy, my monkey?  JANITOR: Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.  ROSS: Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.  JANITOR: The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?  ROSS: That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.  JANITOR: Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?  ROSS: That guy Lipson?  JANITOR: Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?  ROSS: No, I, I only know Lipson.  JANITOR: Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...  ROSS: Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.

FRIEND: She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]  [Scene: Joey's co-star's apartment. Chandler and Joey are at the brunch.]  JOEY: Can you believe this place?  CHANDLER: I know, this is a great apartment.  JOEY: Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.  CHANDLER: Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.  JOEY'S CO-STAR: Hey.  JOEY: Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.  JOEY'S CO-STAR: Thanks. You want it?  JOEY: Huh?  JOEY'S CO-STAR: Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.  JOEY: Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?  JOEY'S CO-STAR: Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.  CHANDLER: [being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.  [Scene: Mr. Geller's party. Mr. Geller and a friend are questioning Richard while Ross observes.]  MR. GELLER: C'mon, tell us.  FRIEND: Yeah, is she really 20.  RICHARD: I am not telling you guys anything.  MR. GELLER: C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.  ROSS: Dad, you really don't want to do that.  MR. GELLER: Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?  RICHARD: Jack, would you let it go?  MR. GELLER: Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.  RICHARD: Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.  MR. GELLER: Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .  ROSS: Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.  MR. GELLER: What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.  [Scene: Tattoo parlor. Phoebe and Rachel are deciding on tattoos.]  PHOEBE: OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?  RACHEL: Well I. . .  PHOEBE: I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.  TATTOO ARTIST: Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.  PHOEBE: Here we go.  RACHEL: [reluctantly] Uh-huh.  PHOEBE: You're not going?  RACHEL: Uh-huh.  PHOEBE: What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?  RACHEL: No. Well, yeah, maybe.  PHOEBE: I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?  RACHEL: What's 1922?  PHOEBE: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?  RACHEL: Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .  PHOEBE: OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?  RACHEL: No.  PHOEBE: OK, who is the boss of you?!!  RACHEL: You?  PHOEBE: No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!  [Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica is in the bathroom and Richard comes in.]  RICHARD: How ya doin'?  MONICA: I'm a twinkie.  RICHARD: Really? I'm a hero.  MONICA: Oh, this is so hard.  RICHARD: Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.  MONICA: Maybe we should just tell your parents first.  RICHARD: My parents are dead.  MONICA: God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.  RICHARD: I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.  MONICA: Alright.  RICHARD: [walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the bathroom] Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.  MRS. GELLER: Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.  [Monica jumps in the shower. Right after Mrs. Geller enters the bathroom, Mr. Geller peeks his head in.]  MR. GELLER: Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.  MRS. GELLER: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?  MR. GELLER: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.  MRS. GELLER: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.  MR. GELLER: Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.  MRS. GELLER: Really.  MR. GELLER: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.  MRS. GELLER: So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?  MR. GELLER: Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.  MRS. GELLER: [they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.  MR. GELLER: C'mon, it's my birthday.  [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are returning from their brunch.]  JOEY: Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.  CHANDLER: Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.  JOEY: Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.  CHANDLER: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.  JOEY: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.  CHANDLER: What?  JOEY: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.  CHANDLER: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.  JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.  CHANDLER: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.  JOEY: Well that's how I feel.  CHANDLER: Well then maybe you should take it.  JOEY: Well then maybe I will.  CHANDLER: Fine with me.  JOEY: Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.  [Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Mr. and Mrs. Geller enter looking particularly refreshed. Monica follows looking rather pale.]  MR. GELLER: Who's drink can I freshen?  MRS. GELLER: Almost time for cake.  ROSS: Mon, Mon, are you OK?  MONICA: You remember that video I found of mom and dad?  ROSS: Yeah.  MONICA: Well, I just caught the live show.  ROSS: Eww.  [Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica and Richard are alone in the kitchen.]  MONICA: Hey there.  RICHARD: What?  MONICA: Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.  RICHARD: Humm, really?  [Mrs. Geller and Ross both enter]  MRS. GELLER: Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?  RICHARD: Uhh, not that I know of.  MRS. GELLER: Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?  RICHARD: That - that's an idea.  MONICA: Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.  MRS. GELLER: Oh?  RICHARD: Oh?  ROSS: Ohh.  MRS. GELLER: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?  ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?  MRS. GELLER: So, who's the mystery man?  MONICA: Well, uh, he's a doctor.  MRS. GELLER: A real doctor?  MONICA: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]  MRS. GELLER: Well that's wonderful. . . I  MONICA: Mom, it's OK.  RICHARD: It is Judy.  MRS. GELLER: Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!  MR. GELLER: [enters with his bat] Found it.  ROSS: I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]  MRS. GELLER: It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.  MR. GELLER: That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.  MONICA: Dad, I'm the twinkie.  MR. GELLER: You're the twinkie?  RICHARD: She's not a twinkie.  MONICA: Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .  MRS. GELLER: Oh please, a relationship.  MONICA: Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.  RICHARD: Really?  MONICA: Yes.  MR. GELLER: Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?  MONICA: Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.  MR. GELLER: When did I say that?  MONICA: Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.  [Everyone else enters and all start singing Happy Birthday.]  [Scene: Tattoo parlor. Rachel is showing Phoebe her tattoo.]  PHOEBE: Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.  RACHEL: I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.  PHOEBE: Ahh.

PHOEBE: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  RACHEL: Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.  PHOEBE: I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?  RACHEL: Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.  [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is at the bar and Joey enters.]  JOEY: Hey.  CHANDLER: Hey.

You know, 'till I get real ones.  CHANDLER: What?  JOEY: Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.  CHANDLER: No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?  JOEY: I'm movin' out like we talked about.  CHANDLER: Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.  JOEY: Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.  CHANDLER: Well, there you go.  JOEY: Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.  CHANDLER: Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.  JOEY: Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?  CHANDLER: I did pay for half of it.  JOEY: Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.  CHANDLER: Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.  JOEY: Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.  CHANDLER: Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.  JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?  [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are setting the table.]  MONICA: So, are you sorry that I told them?

RACHEL: That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.  PHOEBE: OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.  RACHEL: Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns]  ROSS: You got a tattoo?  RACHEL: Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.  ROSS: Lemme see. [looks]  RACHEL: Well?  ROSS: Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.  RACHEL: Really?  ROSS: Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?  RACHEL: I guess.  ROSS: Hey, save us some pizza. [they go off to Rachel's room]  [Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler and Joey are playing foosball for the table.]  JOEY: Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.

[Chandler gives him a look] except when we are here.  PHOEBE: I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.  MONICA: I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.  RACHEL: Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?  JOEY: Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.  CHANDLER: [quietly] Yeah, I remember.  ROSS: Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.  [Everyone except Joey and Chandler leave.]  CHANDLER: So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?

391~391~48~Central Perk, the whole gang is there as Joey enters]  RACHEL: Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?  JOEY: Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.  ALL: Who?  JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.  ALL: Wow!  JOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.  CHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute.  JOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.  ROSS: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at him in disbelief) Or you just do it.  JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional.  MONICA: Then what's the problem?  JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.   PHOEBE: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.  OPENING CREDITS  [Scene: continued from earlier]  CHANDLER: Hey, what did your agent say?  JOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.  MONICA: What, forget it!  RACHEL: Yeah, right.  JOEY: Come on, I need your help here.  PHOEBE: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.  JOEY: You see this, this is a friend.  PHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.  JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?  MONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.  JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)  ROSS: Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)  CHANDLER: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.  [Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Richard are there]  ROSS: (entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! (turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.  (Rachel enters in this hideous pink bride's maid dress, with a huge silver bow on her chest, and a big, huge skirt, kinda like the one's women wore in the 1800s, Monica and Richard both stare in shock)  PHOEBE: (laughing) Oh my God, you look so good!  RACHEL: I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseou
392~392~49~"Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Joey are there, Joey is on the phone.]  JOEY: Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an Indian and walks into  his room)  (the computer bing, bongs)  PHOEBE: Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?  CHANDLER: What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.  (bing, bong)  PHOEBE: Oh, my.  CHANDLER: What?  PHOEBE: She wants to meet you in person.  CHANDLER: Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.  PHOEBE: What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.  CHANDLER: Okay, I'll do it!  PHOEBE: Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! (Chandler runs and picks up his shoes) Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. (Chandler runs to the bathroom, as the computer bing-bongs) No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. (Chandler runs to the computer) No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. (Chandler walks slowly into the kitchen)  [Scene: at Barry and Mindy's reception, Monica and Richard are sitting at a table, and Monica is trying to throw a piece of candy into his mouth.]  MONICA: Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.  RICHARD: Okay, last chance. (Monica throws the candy and hits some woman in the back of the head, Richard turns around and says) Again, I'm sorry.  MONICA: You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I...(sees two little girls dancing together) I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.  BEST MAN: (standing up) Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. (clears throat, and starts reading his toast) I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...  ALL: What?!  BEST MAN: What, (to Barry) you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. (gets a 'da-doom-chesh' from the drummer) Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...  RACHEL: What.  BEST MAN: No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! (da-doom-chesh)  ROSS: (standing up) Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...  RACHEL: Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?  ROSS: Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.  RACHEL: Oh dear God.  ROSS: Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.  RACHEL: (to Ross) She you in the parking lot.  ROSS: (runs after her) No, Rach!  BARRY: And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?  RACHEL: (after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh). See now, tonight, all I  really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well (laughing), I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except....(starts singing) ""Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers (band joins in), feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would...""  ROSS: Marenge,  RACHEL: (singing) ""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody..""  ROSS: Everybody!  RACHEL: At the Copa, Copa Cabana (everyone joins in) The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....  [Scene: later, Richard and Monica are dancing]  RICHARD: Okay, I'll do it.  MONICA: You'll do what?  RICHARD: If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.  MONICA: Oh my God!

Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.  MONICA: You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'  RICHARD: But you're not.  MONICA: Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.  RICHARD: God. I love you.  MONICA: I know you do. Me too. (pause) So what now?  RICHARD: I guess we just keep dancing.  [Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Rachel, Ross, Joey, and Phoebe are there waiting for Chandler's cyberchick to arrive]  CHANDLER: Where is she, Where is she?

ROSS: (seeing her also) Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.  PHOEBE: Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...  (Chandler's date walks in)  CHANDLER: Oh my God! (it's Janice)  JANICE: OH.....MY.....GAWD!! (Chandler rushes over and kisses her)  ALL: OH.....MY.....GOD!!  CLOSING CREDITS  [Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is reading a script as Ross enters]  ROSS: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend.
